# OS concurrency and synchronization methods

These code snippets in C demonstrate the use of multithreading and synchronisation methods such as ` mutex locks,conditional variables, semaphores` etc. to simulate several real life processes.

**One can check the respective folders for detailed README for each simulation.**

## Question 1: Concurrent Merge Sort

Exploring performance comparison between normal mergesort, mergesort using forked processes and mergesort using threads.

## Question 2: Back to College

Simulating delivery of vaccines from manufacturers to vaccination centers, vaccination of students returning back to college in the COVID era etc.

## Question 3: Musical Mayhem

Simulation of a musical concert dealing with arrival of performers, scheduling their performances as per their musical instruments and other preferences, and rewarding successful performers.

**Note: Detailed explaination for each question can be found in [here](./Concurrency.pdf)**
